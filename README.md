Gaming Recorder Assistant (GRA)
==============

![GRALOGO](http://i.imgur.com/K6JveDH.png)

A tool made primarily for YouTubers who focus on gaming-content. This tools allows you to track the time during recording a video. 
Often you have a pre-set deadline you want to match. E.x. 20 minutes of content. This program will allow you to track your "breaks" (that you will remove post-editing),
add marks (used for post-editing) and generally aswell as a stopwatch.

CONFIGURATION
--------------

In the configuration-window you are able to set the hotkeys that the program uses. Normally the best option would be to use the same hotkeys as your recording-software (e.g. Open Broadcaster Software or FRAPS use).

INSTALLATION
--------------
Currently there is no release, however you can clone this repository and compile the program if you want! A release should be out shortly.
